## Develop a new RMarkdown document:

* R version installed: 
```{r}
version
```

* load libraries
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#installing necessary libraries
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(spData)
library(RColorBrewer)
#devtools::install_github("Nowosad/spDataLarge") --> this library could not be installed. 

```


* Includes 2-3 code examples of R that youâ€™ve learned as code chunks. This can be from introductory learning materials, and/or from the chapter readings this week.

### Example 1: 
```{r}
# example 1: summary statistics for GDP per capita for the 177 countries in the data set
 library(spData)  # the file wouldn't knit because it couldn't find "world", but by loading the necessary library right before the error fixed this problem. It then occurred a few more times with the raster and st_transform functions so call the needed libraries below a few times. 
summary(world["gdpPercap"])


```

### Example 2: 
```{r}

# example 2: plotting a map of life expectancy for the 177 countries in the data set
library("sf")
world_proj <- st_transform(world, "+proj=eck4")
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
lines <- st_graticule()
lines <- st_transform(lines, crs = "+proj=eck4")
plot(world_proj["lifeExp"], main="Life Expectancy", graticule=T, reset=FALSE)
plot(lines$geometry, add = TRUE, col = "lightgrey")

```


### Example 3: 
```{r}
# example 3: raster of random numbers
library(RColorBrewer)
library(raster)
valrast <- runif(10000,0,100)
cols <- brewer.pal(n = 9, name = "PuBu")
my_raster <- raster(nrows = 100, ncols = 100, xmn=0,xmx=100,ymn=0,ymx=100, res=1, vals =valrast)
plot(my_raster, col=cols, main="Random Values Raster")
```
